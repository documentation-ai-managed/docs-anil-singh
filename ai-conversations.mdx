  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      avatar: 'hanuman',
      message: 'Tell me about your leap to Lanka.',
      context: 'Ramayana Yuddha Kanda'
    })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data.reply);
  ```
  ```python
  import requests

  response = requests.post(
      'https://api.example.com/v1/chat',
      headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      json={'avatar': 'hanuman', 'message': 'Tell me about your leap to Lanka.', 'context': 'Ramayana Yuddha Kanda'}

## Best Practices for Meaningful Interactions

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Avoid Vague Questions" default-open="true">
    Instead of `Tell me about Ramayana`, ask `How did Rama uphold dharma in exile?`.

    Vague inputs yield general overviews; specifics unlock nuanced wisdom.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Build on Responses">
    Reference prior answers: `Expanding on Rama's bow-breaking, what followed?`.

    Creates threaded, evolving dialogues.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Respect Cultural Depth">
    Acknowledge epic's sanctity: `With reverence, share insights on vanara sena loyalty.`

    Enhances respectful, immersive exchanges.
